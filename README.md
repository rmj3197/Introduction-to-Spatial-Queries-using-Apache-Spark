# Introduction-to-Spatial-Queries-using-Apache-Spark
Data is the new fuel. And with the introduction of Big Data systems, we have been able to extract more and more useful information from large data files. In this project, we work with Geo-Spatial data. Geo-Spatial Data is about objects, events, or phenomena that have a location on the surface of the earth. Geo-Spatial data combines location information (usually coordinates on the earth), attribute information (the characteristics of the object, event, or phenomena concerned), and often also temporal information (the time or life span at which the location and attributes exist). Geo-Spatial databases support a special type of query known as Spatial Query that allows the use of points, lines, and polygons. This project aims at developing and running multiple such spatial queries on a large database containing geographic data and real-time location data of customers obtained from a peer-topeer taxicab firm.
